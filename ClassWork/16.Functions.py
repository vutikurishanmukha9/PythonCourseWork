'''Functions

Definition of Functions

A function in Python is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. It helps in breaking 
down large programs into smaller, manageable parts. Functions improve code reusability, readability, and modularity.

Features of Functions in Python
1. Code Reusability - Write once, use multiple times.
2. Modularity - Divide code into logical sections.
3. Maintainability - Easier to debug and modify.
4. Scalability - Helps in handling complex applications.
5. Encapsulation - Hides implementation details from users.
6. Parameterization - Functions accept arguments to perform operations dynamically.
7. Return Values - Functions can return values for further use.'''

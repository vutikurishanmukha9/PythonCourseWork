# 1. Basic Features of Lists
# ● Ordered: Lists maintain the order of elements.
# ● Mutable: Elements can be modified after creation.
# ● Indexed: Elements can be accessed using an index (starting from 0).
# ● Allow Duplicates: Lists can contain duplicate values.
# ● Heterogeneous: Lists can contain different data types (e.g., int, str, float, etc.).
# ● Dynamic: Size is not fixed; elements can be added or removed dynamically.

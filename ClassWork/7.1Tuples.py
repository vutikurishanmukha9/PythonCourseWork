# 1. Introduction to Tuples
# ● A tuple is an immutable, ordered collection of elements.
# ● Tuples are similar to lists, but once a tuple is created, its contents cannot be changed.
# ● Tuples can store any type of data (int, float, string, list, etc.).
# ● Tuples are faster than lists because they are immutable.

t = () #Decalring the tuple
t = tuple() #Declaring the tuple using the constructor
t = (1,2.3,4+3j,'string',[1,2,3,4,5,6],(1,2,3,4,5,6),True, {1,2,3,4,5,6},{'name': 'xyz'}) #storing the elememts in the tuple

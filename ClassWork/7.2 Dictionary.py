# *Dictionary*
# A dictionary in Python is an ordered, mutable collection that stores key-value pairs.
# Unlike lists or tuples, which are indexed by position, dictionaries are indexed by unique keys.

# 1. Introduction to Dictionary
# A dictionary is defined using curly braces {}, where each key is followed by a colon :, and the key-value pairs are separated by commas.

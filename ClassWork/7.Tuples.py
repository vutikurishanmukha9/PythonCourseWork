# 1. Introduction to Tuples
# ● A tuple is an immutable, ordered collection of elements.
# ● Tuples are similar to lists, but once a tuple is created, its contents cannot be changed.
# ● Tuples can store any type of data (int, float, string, list, etc.).
# ● Tuples are faster than lists because they are immutable.
